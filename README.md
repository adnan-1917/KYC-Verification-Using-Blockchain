### `Problem Statement`

KYC verification in banks is required for updating customer data and verifying customer identity. The banks are responsible for completing the KYC procedure while opening accounts. KYC may be a manual, time-consuming, and redundant across institutions.<br />
Sharing KYC information on Blockchain would be highly beneficial for banks.

### Reason to use blockchain in this process

Blockchain technology allows for the creation of a distributed ledger.</br>

This factor means that there is no one single authority and therefore a point of weakness, as in the client/server model.</br>

It makes it possible to form a system where the user will only need to undergo the KYC procedure once to verify his/her identity.

### Limitations of existing process

Redundancy:  Most large files use similar data and processes to verify an equivalent client.</br>
Inefficiency:  Manual and time-consuming process to collect and verify documentary evidence. </br>
Lack of specificity:  Requirements for due-diligence are often fuzzy, creating uncertainty on compliance to avoid legal sanctions.
